    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took out All of the placeholder variables I put in last week to run/test code and see how it came out > made up a very basic dictionary  \n",
    ">*Tuesday*:  \n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on input/output functionality (created test file to work on it in a simpler form), realized I messed up using arrays (\\[\\*,i\\] in IDL vs. \\[:,i\\] in Python, I think) so fixed that. Won't output anything when I defined it as a function.  \n",
    ">*Wednesday*:  \n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed outputting issue; fixed subplotting/multiplotting formatting. Added to dictionary so data is plotted in all three subplots, messed with the difference between numpy arrays and regular arrays re. the arrays from yesterday. Running function off an input file (a dictionary saved locally onto my computer) without any trouble now, saved as .npy. It's hard to tell how close my plots look to good  \n",
    ">*Thursday*:  \n",
    ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that gave me trouble: indexing an array with another array, what size arrays in dictionary should be (ie. cont_fit and wave are of the same length, which I forget all the time). Still using some filler code when finding yran[1] until I can test with better numbers, since it's dependent on the length of i1, i2, i3, (I think). Plots output and save to a file when subplotting, scaling looks better when plotting three different figures (but each figure has to be saved to a separate file?). Watched seminar talk."
